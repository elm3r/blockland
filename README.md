# blockland alpha
Garbage 2D voxel game. Early alpha.  
Currently just a player and some blocks. 

### Controls
- WASD to move  
- Left Click to break a block  
- Right Click to place a block  
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0 to select blocks.

### Known Issues  
- Collision detection is buggy at best.
- Blocks break immediately, making this a glorified Paint program

### TODO
- Fix collision detection
- Add health bar
- Add proper inventory system
- Add enemies
- Add ores & caves
